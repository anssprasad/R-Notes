#Combine Values into a Vector or List

##Description

This is a generic function which combines its arguments.

The default method combines its arguments to form a vector. All arguments are coerced to a common type which is the type of the returned value, and all attributes except names are removed.

##Usage

c(..., recursive = FALSE)
Arguments

...	
objects to be concatenated.
recursive	
logical. *If recursive = TRUE, the function recursively descends through lists (and pairlists) combining all their elements into a vector*.
